# Trees
###### Tree - A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship. There is only one root parent node and then its child below of it

#### List are linear (straight line) while trees are nonlinear

#### TREE TERMINOLOGY
***Root*** - The top node in a tree<br />
***Child*** -A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.<br />
***Parent*** - The converse notion of a child.<br />
***Siblings*** -A group of nodes with the same parent.<br />
***Leaf*** - A node with no children.<br />
***Edge*** - The connection between one node and another.<br />

### KINDS OF TREES
* Trees
* Binary Trees
* Binary Search Trees

### Lots of different applications!

* HTML DOM
* Network Routing
* Abstract Syntax Tree
* Artificial Intelligence
* Folders in Operating Systems
* Computer File Systems

### Binary Tree
A binary tree is a type of data structure, where each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as left child and right child.

### Lots of different applications as well!

* Decision Trees (true / false)
* Database Indicies
* Sorting Algorithms

### BINARY SEARCH TREES

* Every parent node has at most two children
* Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
* Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
